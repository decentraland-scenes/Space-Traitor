# Space Traitor

This is a multiplayer game about deceiving and guessing other player's identities. It takes plenty of inspiration from Among Us, but brings similar mechanics into a 3d medium.

At least 3 (or better 4) players must ring the bell of the space station, then the game starts.

A traitor is picked randomly, that player will secretly play against the others.
